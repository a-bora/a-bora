- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @a-bora
- Iâ€™m interested in Web Development And Data Analysis.
- Iâ€™m currently learning both of this fields. For Data Analysis I am learning mainly from Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course in Coursera.
  For Web Development I use Roadmap.sh, Mimo app, w3schools, Udemy Course By SadÄ±k E. Turan Node.js Classes.
- Future plans: Finishing both of this courses and my portfolio site, listing my projects here and Linkedin, rearrange my Linkedin profile along with my portfolio site.
- How to reach me: you can reach me from here.
